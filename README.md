- 👋 Hi, I’m Kris and I'm 35 years old. I'm at the very begining of my dive into the World of coding and Software Developing. I haven't set up a dead line when I should become a knowledgebale skillfull Software Developer, as I want to enjoy the ride and give chance to my brain to proccess the hole Universe I'm jumping into. If I dont succeed in to this path, I'm quite sure this knowledge and practice will find expresion else where in my Life.
- 👀 I’m interested in: Out side coding and thechnolodgies, I'm intrested in Spirituality, Methaphysics, Philosophy, Sociology, Mythology,History, the use and effect of Symology as a coded transfer of information troughout our History and current modern life.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning via The Odin Project...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not sure yet...
